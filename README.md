# Stephanie's Blog

I'm using Hugo 0.81 to build my blog, and it's automatically deployed from this repo to a project on [platform.sh](https://platform.sh).

To build locally, you'll need [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

I chose the [zdoc theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-zdoc/) for now because I will be putting some documentation on here later and this also works well as a blog theme.

Pull Requests Accepted :)
