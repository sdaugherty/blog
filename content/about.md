Hello! I'm Stephanie Daugherty. I work as a Cloud Support Engineer at
[Platform.sh](https://platform.sh), where I help our customers make the most
of our continious deployment cloud hosting, and serve as the unofficial
"documentation mom" for our internal documentation.

Outside of work, I spend a fair bit of time gaming, and I also enjoy hiking
and kayaking. 

Some of the games I've been playing recently are [Minecraft]({{ ref . "/interests/minecraft.md" }}, and
[Stardew Valley]({{ ref . "/interests/stardew.md" }}).
