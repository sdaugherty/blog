I've been playing Stardew Valley a lot lately, after not playing since 1.3. 

## Stardew with more than 4 players

It's possible to play Stardew Valley with more than 4 players by editing in
additional cabins or by using mods.

I normally go the editor route, using [SDVSE](https://stcodematrix.com/projects/stardew.php) to edit the game
save and add extra cabins. When doing this, rememember to move the cabins so
that they are accessible - the default position is somewhere in the wall
beside the bat/mushroom cave on your farm, which isn't very useful.
