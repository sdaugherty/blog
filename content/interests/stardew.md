I've been playing Stardew Valley a lot lately, after not playing since 1.3. 

## Stardew with more than 4 players

It's possible to play Stardew Valley with more than 4 players by editing in
additional cabins or by using mods.

I normally go the editor route, using [SDVSE](https://stcodematrix.com/projects/stardew.php) to edit the game
save and add extra cabins. When doing this, rememember to move the cabins so
that they are accessible - the default position is somewhere in the wall
beside the bat/mushroom cave on your farm, which isn't very useful. 


## Bats vs Mushrooms

One of the most widely debated decisions Stardew players face is whether to have Bats or Mushrooms in the farm cave.

Bat Cave Advantages:

* The bat cave can allow you to complete the community center bundles much earlier and at a lower cost, most notably the artisan bundle.
* The bat cave potentially gives you access to out of season fruits and forage.
* Items in the bat cafe count towards foraging XP.
* The bat cave only needs to be checked once a week, before sleeping on Saturday, while the mushroom cave will not produce anything if there are uncollected items.
* Fruits are at least neutral or better gifts for virtually all NPCs


Mushroom Cave Advantages:

* The mushroom cave produces items every single day.
* The mushroom cave is a good food source, and can give you a constant supply of life elixers.
* The mushroom cave can also be used to complete community center bundles.

### Conclusion

If the Mushroom cave is a daily routine, it's easily more valuable than the bat cave over the long term.

However, if you're forgetful, or skip days regularly, or if you're just interested in completing bundles quickly, all of the mushrooms necessary for those bundles will likely be picked up via the course of mining and checking the secret wood regularly, while the fruits cannot otherwise be obtained outside of planting fruit trees, making it a huge advantage toward finishing the community center in your first year. Most speedrunning strategies will choose the bats for this reason.

Additionally, now that 1.5 is out, you'll gain access to a mushroom cave on Ginger Island after finishing the community center - something that the bat cave helps you do earlier in the game than would otherwise be possible.
