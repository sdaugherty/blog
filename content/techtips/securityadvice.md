Friends and family sometimes ask me about how to stay safe online. I've
compiled a few tips on computer security here.

{{< notice warning "Caution" >}}
This guide is intended for the average user, and represents what I consider
the bare minimum needed to stay safe online. If you are an activist,
journalist, politician, or someone else in a high-risk situation, then there
are a lot more concerns for you than this can possibly address, and you
should check out the Electronic Frontier Foundation's [Surveilance Self
Defense guides](https://ssd.eff.org/en).

## Use a Password Manager

The single most important thing you can do to keep yourself safe online is
to use a completely random and unique password for every site and service
you use. 

This makes a password manager a necessity, as the only way to keep up with
numerous random and unique passwords is to have a password manager generate,
store, and automatically fill those passwords for you.

## Use Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

Multifactor Authentication (MFA), sometimes referred to as "Two Factor
Authentication (2FA), means to use two or more "factors" for logging in.

* Something you know
* Something you have
* Something you are

The point of MFA is that by combining two or more of these, your accounts
can be better protected - someone might be able to guess or steal your password, but
if they also have to steal your phone at the same time, you've got time to
deal with the problem and keep your accounts safe.

## Update your PC, phone, and all your software regularly.

Software has bugs, it's as inevitable as death and taxes, and some of those
bugs can be exploited to do nasty things, like breaking into your computer,
draining your bank accounts, stealing all your bitcoin, and posting nasty
stuff to your Instagram. Updating your computer regularly minimizes the chances that this is going to happen.


## Be Wary

Learn to ask questions. Is this legit? Is this really from the person who it
says its from? Is this safe?

Most attacks these days have an element of social engineering - that is,
abusing someone's trust in order to further some nefarious goal. This can be
straightforward as sending someone a link to a fake login page to collect
usernames and passwords, it can be a way to distribute malware, or it can be
part of a complex play to get information and get closer to a more valuable
target.


## Use antivirus software

Antivirus software provides a last line of defense against malware, in case you accidently
download or click on something harmful, or in case something that was
harmless at the time gets replaced with something bad.

It isn't a gurantee of safety, but it does potentially give your computer one last
chance to stop malware before it's too late and your files are ransomed or
your passwords stolen.

Windows 10 comes with included antivirus software, in the form of Windows
Defender. Use it. Don't turn it off unless you are replacing it with
something else. If you're using other operating systems, you'll probably
have to find your own antivirus.

## Backups

Having backups of your important data will allow you to recover from a
catastrophic loss, as well as from a simple mistake. 

There's a few different methods of backing up your data that you can use, so lets look at the differences between them.

### Online vs Offline

An online backup is one which is constantly connected and available. You can back up data more frequently, even continiously if so desired, and you can restore information immediately.
However, depending on how you've set up your backups, an online backup may not be safe against intentional deletion, including deletion by malware, since the backup is always accessible and writable.

An offline backup is one which is disconnected after it has been taken. This is less convenient, however, it provides protection against intentional deletion, since the backup has to be physically connected to be accessible.

### On-site vs Off-site

An on-site backup is a backup located in the same location as the computer. The advantage is it's faster to access, since you don't have to access it over the internet or physically transport media.

An off-site backup is a backup located somewhere other than where you are, the key advantage here is that even if the entire building is destroyed, you can still get your data back.
