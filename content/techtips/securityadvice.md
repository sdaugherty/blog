Friends and family sometimes ask me about how to stay safe online. I've
compiled a few tips on computer security here.

This guide is intended for the average user, and represents what I consider
the bare minimum needed to stay safe online. If you are an activist,
journalist, politician, or someone else in a high-risk situation, then there
are a lot more concerns for you than this can possibly address, and you
should check out the Electronic Frontier Foundation's [Surveilance Self
Defense guides](https://ssd.eff.org/en).

## Use a Password Manager

The single most important thing you can do to keep yourself safe online is
to use a completely random and unique password for every site and service
you use. 

This makes a password manager a necessity, as the only way to keep up with
numerous random and unique passwords is to have a password manager generate,
store, and automatically fill those passwords for you.

## Use Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

Multifactor Authentication (MFA), sometimes referred to as "Two Factor
Authentication (2FA), means to use two or more "factors" for logging in.

* Something you know
* Something you have
* Something you are

The point of MFA is that by combining two or more of these, your accounts
can be better protected - someone might be able to guess or steal your password, but
if they also have to steal your phone at the same time, you've got time to
deal with the problem and keep your accounts safe.

## Update your PC, phone, and all your software regularly.

Software has bugs, it's as inevitable as death and taxes, and some of those
bugs can be exploited to do nasty things, like breaking into your computer,
draining your bank accounts, stealing all your bitcoin, and posting nasty
stuff to your Instagram. Updating your computer regularly minimizes the chances that this is going to happen.
