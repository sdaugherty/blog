In this post, I'm going to cover some general information about upgrading
and building a PC.

## Upgrade or Build


### Two Steps Ahead

Small upgrades are generally not worth the investment - a good upgrade is
one that provides enough of an improvement to be subjectively noticable
even by someone who didn't know that an upgrade had taken place. In terms of
performance, you generally need a 30% or better improvement in performance to
hit this mark.

A good rule of thumb to achieve these kind of meaningful upgrades is “two steps
ahead”. What that means is that you want upgrades that put you ahead of your
current component by two tiers, two generations, or a tier and a generation.

A "price tier" or "market segment" refers to the distinction between
different components in the same product generation - manufacturers of PC
hardware generally have a range of product offerings which come out at
rougly the same time, which allow them to cater to different budgets and
performance needs while also allowing them to reduce waste. For example,
Intel's i3, i5, i7, and i9 processors are all different "tiers" of what's
essentially the same product, as are nVidia's RTX 3060, RTX 3070, RTX 3080, and
RTX 3090 graphics cards. All of these products are in the same family, and
often share the same manufacturing processes, but the higher tiers offer
better performance.

Every 1-3 years, new product generations arive, with a whole new set of
products spread across those price tiers. For the past decade or so, these
generational improvements typically bring performance increases which shift
the new tier up a step in performance versus the previous generation -
evolutionary, rather than revolutionary improvement. So, for example, when
you go from a GTX 1070 to a RTX 2070, you should roughly see the same
performance increase as going from GTX 1070 to GTX 1080.

These numbers obviously are a generalization of the overall pattern of
hardware development, but they've held mostly true for the past decade or
more - check reviews and benchmarks to be sure, but it's a close enough
assumption to plan your upgrades around.

Going two product tiers, two generations, or a tier and a generation foward
will make it highly likely that you'll hit that magic 30% or better
improvement that you'll really feel, rather than just a smaller improvement
that you need benchmarks to even notice.

### Don't Invest into Obsolescence

Don’t invest further into obsolescence. When you are considering an upgrade,
and you are on a budget, it may be tempting to just upgrade an existing PC
when you really should build a new one.

A good rule of thumb here to avoid sinking money into something that's
already a lost cause is to avoid buying any components as an upgrade that you
couldn't or wouldn't use to build a new PC.

As an example, say you've got an older Intel Core i5 processor, on a
motherboard that uses DDR3 memory, but newer PCs use DDR4 memory. On that
PC, you probably wouldn't want to spend money on memory, since that memory
can't be used as part of a new build, but you might be able to benefit from
a new SSD or a new GPU, even if you're going to build a new PC in a few
months to a year, since you'll be able to bring those components with you.

If you choose to ignore this advice and do it anyway, then please don't pay
full price - take advantage of the used market, and put the savings towards
a new build down the line.

### Be Aware of Upgrade Cycles

Do stay informed about product refresh cycles. Major component manufacturers have more or less predictable cycles for releasing new generations of products, usually on 12-36 month cycles.

There are several things that will happen around the time a new product generation
arrives, both good and bad.

* Retailers will often start to reduce or even liquidate their stocks of the
  old part in advance of the new release. This can be a good time for sales,
  but it also means supplies may become limited in the weeks leading up to the
  new product launch.
* Once the new parts release, supplies may be quite limited as everyone
  rushes to upgrade. This can result in temporarily inflated prices.
* Once supplies stabilize the new generation will likely be a meaningful
  improvement over the previous one, meaning you can get more for your
  money, as long as you wait until the rush is over
* The release may be staggered - frequently manifacturers drop their top of
  the line products first and then lower tiers in the weeks or even months that
  follow.
* Secondary markets will be flooded with used hardware from the previous generation,
  making it possible to get deep discounts on used hardware.
* Retailers may offer deep discounts on remaining stock of the previous
  generation.
