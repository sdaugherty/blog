Let's talk about the word "queer", it's history, what it has come to mean, what it has in common with the world "gay", and why it's important.

## Meaning

Queer has come to be an unbrella term for the entire spectrum of identities which are not cisheteronormative, that is every letter you can imagine having a place in the LGBTQIA+ alphabet soup. Unlike the LGBTQIA+ acronym though, the word queer does not try to enumerate those identities, and thus, it is inherently both vague and inclusive, covering every variation on sexuality and gender that exists outside the cisheteronormative space without the need to specify what those identities are.

## History

Queer shares a similar history to that of the word gay, as a reclaimed slur.

Queer originally entered the English language in the 16th centry as an adjective describing "strange or peculiar" behavior, as well as persons who exhibited such behavior. It wasn't until much later that the term began to be used to refer to homosexuality. The first such recorded usage was in the 19th century, as a perjorative term for gay men.

Queer would quickly become adopted by the same group it was originally used against, as various subcultures of gay men emerged. By the turn of the 20th century, it had been reclaimed by one of these subcultures - those gay men who self-described as masculine, as opposed to more effeminate identities.

By the 1940s, younger gay men had rejected the term queer in favor of the world "gay", abandoning a word that a generation before had reclaimed. 

Queer would again be taken up by a portion of the gay rights movement of the 1960s, undergoing a second reclaimation as activists used it in open defiance of repression and police brutality, thus the story of the word is entertwined with the earliest struggles for gay rights.

Queer disappeared from common usage again following the worst of those struggles, reemerging to be reclained a third time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and it was once again taken up by activists at the height of the AIDS pandemic, this time as an inclusive term, famously cemented as such by the manifesto [Queers Read This](http://www.qrd.org/qrd/misc/text/queers.read.this). Queer quickly grew into an inclusive term following these struggles, and was even taken up by the mainstream as an accepted term at this time. The word queer had quickly become both widely accepted, and radically inclusive. It was taken up not just by those in the movement, but by universities, media, and the general public, and its mainstream usage overshadowed its history as a slur.

While this third reclaimation was not without controversy, it was perhaps the most successful reclaimation of the term, and today it remains as an accepted term - we have "queer studies" programs in many universities, the word queer is used widely in the media without the perjorative context, and the term remains a rallying cry for activists fighting for civil rights, including the fight for marriage eqality and the fight for protections against discrimination.

## The status of queer today

> We're here, and we're queer.

Today, many of us wear the word as a badge of pride and solidarity with those who have fought, often times with their lives, for our right to exist. Still others, who still remember being targeted at them in the time between Stonewall, and its third reclaimation in the 90s reject it. However the largest push against the term queer today comes from those outside the LGBTQIA+ community, because solidarity and radical inclusiveness threaten their ability to divide and renew oppression against us. They seek to remind us of the word queer's painful past to force us to enumerate our identities, and to give specific labels which can be singled out and targeted. They seek to divide us from those who fought for our right to exist.

## In defense of the word 

The word queer is so intertwined with the struggles for gay and trans rights that to give it up again after so many have used it as a rallying cry would be to erase the memory of those struggles, and of those who fought and continue to fight simply to be allowed to exist and enjoy the same rights to live, work, and love as cisheteronormative society. 

More importantly, the inclusiveness of the word is liberating - instead of describing myself as a "demisexual transgender lesbian", and explaining what all of those labels mean, or sometimes even defending those labels, I can simply say "I'm queer".  

I am proud to describe myself as queer today, because I know that those who came before me fought for that word, because there's not that much distance between those struggles, and my own struggle to exist and be recognized, and because even today, we're still fighting to keep the rights many of us gave up our lives to secure.
